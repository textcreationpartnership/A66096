            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We have therefore the Character of a Good RULER Recommended to us in the Word of GOD, and Exemplified in ſome who deſerved that Epithete, not only to let men know when GOD favours them with ſuch a Bleſſing, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Him His deſerved Praiſe for it; but alſo, both to Inſtruct ſuch into whoſe hands it falls, how to Demean themſelves in their Authority, ſo as to be a Common Good; and to direct thoſe unto whoſe truſt it is Committed, what manner of Perſons they ought to introduce, it they would either Pleaſe GOD, or Conſult their own and their Peoples Welfare.</p>
            <p>Such a <hi>Character</hi> we find is given in our Text; and we may ſuppoſe <hi>David</hi> intended for an Inſtance of it.</p>

               <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> are all ſuch as are in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of a rightful Authority over others. Theſe do not all of them ſtand in one equal Rank, nor are alike influential into Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There are Supream and Subordinate Powers: and of theſe alſo there are ſome who have a <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> others an <hi>Executive</hi> Power in their Hands; which two, though they may ſometimes meet in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet are in themſelves things of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nature.

            <p>They muſt alſo be acquainted with the Rules of Righteouſneſs; they muſt know

            <p>Finally, he muſt be one who prefers the publick Benefit above all private and ſeparate Intereſts whatſoever. Every man in his place, owes himſelf to the good of the whole; and if he doth not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote himſelf, he is unjuſt: and he who either to advance himſelf, or to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on another, will puſh on Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Laws, or pervert the true Intention of ſuch as are in Force, is an unjuſt man: and he who is under the influence of a <hi>Narrow Spirit,</hi> will be ready to do ſo, as occaſion offers.</p>
            <p>Nor is this <hi>Juſtice</hi> to be lookt upon as ſeparate from the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> but as influenced and maintained by it. He therefore that <hi>Ruleth in the Fear of God,</hi> is one who Acknowledgeth God to be his Soveraign, and carries in his heart an Awful Fear of him: who owns his Commiſſion to be from him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ere long to be called to give in an Account of his managing of it: which maketh him to ſtudy in all things to pleaſe him, and to be afraid of doing any thing that will provoke him.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, he is a Student in the Law of God, and <hi>Meditates in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If he hath any thing to do in the making of Laws, he will conſult a good Conſcience, and what may be pleaſing of God, and will be far from <hi>framing miſchief by a Law.</hi> And if he be to execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yea the <hi>Fear of God</hi> will make him not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n by Him, what a Veneration he hath for the Laws that are enacted for the good of Man-kind.</p>
            <p>In a word, he is one that will take care to promote <hi>Piety</hi> as well as <hi>Honeſty</hi> among<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men; and do his utmoſt that the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may be countenanced and eſtabliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

When men can injoy their Liberties and Rights without moleſtation or oppreſſion; when they can live without fear of being born down by their more Potent Neighbours; when they are ſecured againſt Violence, and may be Righted againſt them that offer them any injury, without fraud; and are encouraged to ſerve God in their own way, with freedom, and without being impoſed upon contrary to the Goſpel precepts; now are they an happy People.
